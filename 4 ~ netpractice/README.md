# netpractice

The ***netpractice*** project at 42 school focuses on understanding and configuring small-scale TCP/IP networks. Through a series of practical exercises, I learned how to properly set up network configurations while mastering core networking concepts.

Key Concepts Covered:
* IP addressing and subnetting
* TCP/IP communication
* Network interfaces configuration
* Static routing
* Network masks and switches

What I Learned:
* How to calculate and apply subnet masks
* Understanding network segmentation
* Troubleshooting network connectivity issues
* Configuring IP addresses and routing tables
* Basic network architecture principles

This project provided hands-on experience with fundamental networking concepts essential for any system administrator or developer.
