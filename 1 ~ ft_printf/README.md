# ft_printf

The ***ft_printf*** project at 42 school is a recreation of the standard C library's printf function. This project challenged me to implement a complex string formatting and output system while handling various data types and conversion specifications.

What I had to do:
* Implement the following conversions:
  * `%c` - Print a single character
  * `%s` - Print a string
  * `%p` - Print a pointer address in hexadecimal
  * `%d` - Print a decimal number
  * `%i` - Print an integer in base 10
  * `%u` - Print an unsigned decimal number
  * `%x` - Print a number in hexadecimal (lowercase)
  * `%X` - Print a number in hexadecimal (uppercase)
  * `%%` - Print a percent sign

To achieve this, I had to:
* Parse format strings to identify conversion specifications
* Handle different data types and their conversions
* Manage memory allocation and string manipulation
* Implement proper error handling
* Ensure accurate output matching the original printf behavior

What I Learned:
* Deep understanding of variadic functions in C
* String parsing and formatting techniques
* Type conversion and number base systems
* Memory management and buffer handling
* Improved code organization and modularity

This project significantly enhanced my C programming skills and understanding of string formatting and type conversion systems.
