# born2beroot

The ***Born2beroot*** project introduced me to system administration by having me create and configure a Virtual Machine under specific rules. This project taught me about system and network administration using **Debian Linux**, covering essential concepts of virtualization, security protocols, and server management.

Key Requirements and Implementations:
* Set up a Virtual Machine using **Oracle VirtualBox**
* Install and configure **Debian** as the operating system
* Implement strict password policies and user management
* Configure **SSH** service on a specific port
* Set up **UFW** (Uncomplicated Firewall) for network security
* Install and configure **sudo** with strict rules
* Create a strong partitioning scheme using **LVM**
* Set up a cron job for system evaluation script
* Configure and manage system services

Security Features:
* Password aging and complexity requirements
* User and group management policies
* Sudo usage logging and restricted paths
* SSH configuration with key-based authentication
* UFW rules for port management
* System monitoring and logging

What I Learned:
* Virtual Machine creation and management
* Linux system administration fundamentals
* Security policy implementation
* Service configuration and maintenance
* Network security basics
* System monitoring and maintenance
* Bash scripting for automation

Born2beroot was essential in understanding the fundamentals of system administration and security, providing hands-on experience with real-world server management tasks.
